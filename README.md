**Project Summary**
Customer Personality Analysis is a comprehensive examination of a company's ideal customers, enabling the business to gain a deeper understanding of its customer base and tailor its products to meet the unique needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer segments.

By conducting a Customer Personality Analysis, businesses can better identify and target specific customer segments. Instead of spending resources on marketing a new product to every customer in their database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to purchase the product and focus their marketing efforts on that particular segment. This targeted approach can result in more effective marketing campaigns, higher conversion rates, and increased revenue.

The aim of the project is to analyze the transaction data set of a UK-based non-store online retail business specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. Through this analysis, the project seeks to identify various customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, purchasing frequency, and average spend. The ultimate goal is to gain insights that can aid the business in optimizing its marketing and sales strategies to better serve its customers, leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.

**Problem Statement**

Understanding the value of each customer is crucial for any business, and the RFM analysis is a popular method used for this purpose. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, and it is a technique that helps businesses analyze their customers' value based on these three parameters.

By using RFM analysis, businesses can segment their customers into groups based on their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and the monetary value of their purchases. The resulting segments can then be ordered from the most valuable customers (those with the highest recency, frequency, and value) to the least valuable customers (those with the lowest recency, frequency, and value).

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing the customer base into groups of individuals based on common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. By performing customer segmentation using RFM analysis, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customers' value and tailor their marketing efforts and product offerings to each segment's unique needs and preferences.


**About Dataset**

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The dataset consists of 541909 rows and 8 columns. However, it is important to note that two of these columns contain missing information. Specifically, the CustomerID column has only 406829 values, indicating that some information is missing. The same is true for the Description column. When looking at the summary statistics generated by the describe function, it is apparent that some negative values exist in the data.

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers

**InvoiceNo**: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

**StockCode**: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

**Description**: Product (item) name. Nominal.

**Quantity**: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.

**InvoiceDate**: Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.

**UnitPrice**: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.

**CustomerID**: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.

**Country**: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

 **Data Wrangling & Data Vizualization**

 Data wrangling, also known as data preprocessing or data cleaning, refers to the process of transforming and preparing raw data into a suitable format for analysis. It involves cleaning, organizing, and transforming data to ensure its quality, consistency, and compatibility with the analytical tasks at hand.

Data visualization is the process of representing data and information graphically to facilitate understanding, exploration, and communication of insights. It involves creating visual representations such as charts, graphs, maps, and infographics to effectively convey patterns, trends, relationships, and comparisons present in the data.

 **Hypothesis Testing**

 * t_test.:A t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups of data to determine whether there is a significant difference between them. It is a hypothesis test that helps in determining whether the difference between the means of the two groups is due to chance or is statistically significant


**Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing**

*  Handling Missing Values
*  Handling Outliers
*  Feature Manipulation & Selection:

we have used RFM method in the form of features, RFM analysis, recency, frequency, and monetary (also known as "monetary value") are three key customer metrics that can be used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Here's a brief explanation of each metric:

Recency: This metric measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are considered to be more valuable than those who haven't made a purchase in a while. Recency is often measured in terms of the number of days since the customer's last purchase.

Frequency: This metric measures how frequently a customer makes purchases. Customers who make more frequent purchases are considered to be more valuable than those who make fewer purchases. Frequency is often measured in terms of the number of purchases made over a certain time period, such as a year or a quarter.

Monetary value: This metric measures the total amount of money that a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who have spent more money are considered to be more valuable than those who have spent less money.

by using above features we are going to implement diffrent diffrent machine model to get optimal solution

* Data Transformation
* Data Scaling
* Dimesionality Reduction


**ML Model Implementation**

In our implementation, we explored a diverse array of clustering models, such as K-Means Clustering, the Elbow Method for optimal K selection, DBSCAN, and Hierarchy Clustering. Among these techniques, DBSCAN stood out as a powerful clustering algorithm with the ability to handle various data types and shapes effectively.

When DBSCAN yielded the optimal clustering result, it showcased its capability to discern the underlying structure in your data successfully. By identifying two optimal clusters based on Recency and Monetary attributes, it revealed the presence of two distinct groups within your data. This valuable insight suggests that these groups can be meaningfully separated and analyzed independently, offering a deeper understanding of the patterns and characteristics within your dataset.

**Conclusion**


*   related to customer segmentation and targeting. By analyzing customer behavior in terms of their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value of purchase, businesses can identify and target high-value customers, personalize marketing campaigns, and improve customer retention.


*   different clustering algorithms were applied to the dataset, including clustering on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) with 2 optimal clusters found. 

*  DBScan method performing well on our data set with  optimal number of culuster is two on the features using Recency Monetary
